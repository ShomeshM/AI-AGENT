This project is a FastAPI-based backend that uses an LLM (via Ollama) to convert natural language queries into SQL for a PostgreSQL database containing sales, product, and total data. It can return query results as JSON or generate bar chart visualizations as images. The project supports CSV-to-Postgres loading and is ready for local development.
